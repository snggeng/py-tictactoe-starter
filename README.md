# Starter Code for Tic Tac Toe in Python
This repo is starter code for one of the projects done in KopiHack, a weekly meetup that 
I lead at Duke University for beginners wanting to learn to code. Feel free use this to create your own Tic Tac Toe!

KopiHack's python gitbook can be found [here](https://snggeng.gitbooks.io/intro-to-python/content/).

If you study at duke and are interested, get in touch with me at geng.sng@duke.edu or via [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sng.geng).
